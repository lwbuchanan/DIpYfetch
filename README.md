# <span style=color:magenta>DIpYfetch</span>
A simple python script to display some OS and PC hardware info in the command line.

DIpYfetch was highly inspired by [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch), [pfetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pfetch), and other similar tools. I built it in windows, but plan to add linux support with added tags to display desktop environment, window manager, distro etc. 

This is not an optimized script in the slightest; I built it as a quick side project just to get comfortable building python apps. Hopefully, as I improve at python, it will be more efficient. I'm challenging myself to use as few external modules as possible. If I ever want to make this tool actually useful, I'll probobly rewrite it in C.
